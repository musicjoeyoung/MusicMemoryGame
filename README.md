# MusicMemoryGame

## Description: 
My goal was to make a game that tests the user's ability to strengthen their tonal and visual memory.
## Goals: 
Right now there isn't true "win/lose" conditions,but rather "good job/wrong answer" conditions. I plan adding the functionality that keeps track of wrong guesses, apply a limit to them (before the user has to start over), and keep track of how many melodies they got right or wrong.

Visually the user will not be able to view the next level of melodies until successfully completing the prior one. A function will be added that will randomly generate melodies as to not have to manually create them and muddy up the code.

Users will be able to save their progress and resume their progression at any time.
